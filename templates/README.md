[Fritzing](http://fritzing.org/) project templates for [Clixx.IO](http://clixx.io) Tab boards.

These files can be used as templates for your own designs to ensure that your
boards fit the pin outs and dimensions required for interoperability with the
Clixx system. The Fritzing files contain double sided PCB's with custom board
shapes as well as a stripboard layout in place of the normal breadboard view.

The SVG files used to make the custom board shapes in Fritzing are also
provided as separate files if you would like to use a different program to
design your boards.

# 3.3V Regulator

A simple voltage regulator to generate 3.3V from a 5V source. Useful when
interfacing to the Raspberry Pi or connecting 3.3V level components to an
Arduino.

Provides pass-through of the 5V input and two sets of headers for 3.3V output.

Stripboard layout only at this stage.

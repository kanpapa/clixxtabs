# 3.3V Regulator

A simple voltage regulator to generate 3.3V from a 5V source. Useful when
interfacing to the Raspberry Pi or connecting 3.3V level components to an
Arduino. Based on the [Microchip MCP1700](http://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/Devices.aspx?dDocName=en010642)
LDO regulator.

Provides pass-through of the 5V input and two sets of headers for 3.3V output.
Maximum current is 250 mA.

Stripboard layout only at this stage.

Clixx.Tabs - A collection of Tab designs by The Garage Lab
---------------------------------------------------------

This repository contains a set of Tab designs compatible with the [Clixx.IO](http://clixx.io)
system developed by [David Lyon](https://github.com/clixx-io) and are released
under the
[Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/deed.en_GB)
as is the original project.

This is a companion project to [Clixx.Dock](https://github.com/thegaragelab/clixxdock)
which provides adaptors and physical docks for use with the Clixx system and
[Clixx.Lib](https://github.com/thegaragelab/clixxlib) which provides software
support for a range of controller boards.

The contents of the repositorary are split into three sections:

1. In the *templates* directory are [Fritzing](http://www.fritzing.org) projects
   for blank SingleTab and TwinTab boards. These include custom shaped PCB's
   matching the Clixx.IO specification with connectors positions in the correct
   locations as well as stripboard layouts for making prototype boards. The
   directory also includes SVG files defining the shapes of the PCB's.
3. The *parts* directory contains custom Fritzing parts that are used in the
   boards. You will have to import these into your Fritzing installation in
   order to view the schematic and board layouts for some projects. When a
   board uses a custom part I'll document it in the README.md file for the
   board.
3. The boards themselves are contained in the *twin* directory (for TwinTab
   boards) and the *single* directory (for SingleTab boards). Each board is
   contained in it's own subdirectory and includes a Fritzing project file as
   well as some simple documentation in a README.md file.

The majority of these boards are simple circuits that have been used in various
projects documented on [The Garage Lab](http://thegaragelab.com) and have not
been designed for mass production.

# Contributions

If you have Tabs you have designed yourself and would like to see included in
this repository please [contact me](mailto:shane@thegaragelab.com). For
consistancy I would prefer that you use the provided templates for your board
design although that is not strictly necessary. Likewise, if you find any
problems with the existing content please raise an issue here and I'll attempt
to fix them as soon as possible.
